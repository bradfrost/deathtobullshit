		<p class="intro">People are bombarded by more information, content, notifications, and data than ever before. With the rise of all this information comes a rise of the amount of bullshit people are exposed to. "Death to Bullshit" is a rallying cry to rid our world of the superfluous crap in our lives and create experiences that respect people and their time.</p>
		
		<h3>What is bullshit?</h3>
		<p>Bullshit lies somewhere between ineptitude and <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/">deception</a>. Bullshit can be characterized in a few different ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Superfluous or unnecessary</li>
			<li>Cluttered, clunky, or needlessly complex</li>
			<li>Intentionally deceptive or insincere</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Often in the name of "engagement" or some other organizational goal.</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.

		</blockquote>

		Now that it's easier than ever to produce things, it's becoming increasingly important to   
		
		<h3>People's capacity for bullshit is rapidly diminishing.</h3> 
		We as human beings are trying to maximize our signal and minimize the amount of noise we're exposed to. Ignore this at your own peril.
		
		We have tools (Instapaper, Readability, AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, Hulu Plus, etc)
		
		The hope is that people increasingly appreciate craft, whether it's craft beer, or local food, paying for online services that genuinely make their lives easier or less complicated, or for journalism that takes time, effort and money to produce.
		
		There are new products and services that are cropping up (Simple, Forecast.io) that are subverting entire industries. We as creators have a decision to make, do we want to be part of the 90% of noise, or do we want to be part of the 10% of signal?
		
		<ul>
			<li>Be original.</li>
			<li>Respect your craft.</li>
			<li>Respect people and their time.</li>
		</ul>
