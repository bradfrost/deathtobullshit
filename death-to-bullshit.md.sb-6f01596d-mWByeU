1.1 Information
Once upon a time we had to seek out information. We had to travel to a library. We had to check books out and had to return them after a finite piece of time.

### Books

## Just the beginning
Where we're at now is where the universe was about 1 second after the Big Bang (what's the number). We're just now getting started spraying our particles out into the digital void.

# Death to Bullshit
Ladies and gentlemen, this is just some of what was created in this last minute. 

In just a minute, XXXX posts posted to Facebook. XXXXXX tweets were sent. 72 hours of video were uploaded to Youtube. XXXXXX e-mails were sent. XXXXXX text messages were sentâ€¦. This blows my mind.

This is a story about information, bullshit and craft. 

## The Information
Once upon a time we had to seek out information. We had to travel to a library. We had to check books out and had to return them after a finite piece of time. We We had to make an effort to consume information. We actually had to *read*. We had to go to record stores and movie rental places in order to get access to music and movies. 

Now information is impossible to escape. It comes in all shapes and sizes: books, magazines, snail mail, faxes (believe it, they're still around), photography, AM radio, FM radio, Sirius/XM radio, Pandora, Rdio, Spotify, Last.FM, Cable television, Satellite television, movies, E-mail, newsletters, Facebook wall posts, Facebook messages, Tweets, @ replies, Direct Messages, App.net, text messages, multimedia messages, Instagram, Vine, Flickr,

#### Ways we communicate: 
- The Written Word
	- Books
	- Magazines
-	Snail Mail
- Photography - Analog vs. Digital
	- 10% of all photos ever taken, in the existence of photography were taken last year. 
- Radio - AM, FM, Sirius/XM
- Television - number of channels
- Internet
	- E-mail
-	Blogs
	- Facebook - Wall posts, messages
	- Twitter - @ replies, direct messages
-	Skype - chat, phone calls, video
-	Google+ (if you're a Google employee)
- Mobile
	- SMS
-	FaceTime
	- Native Apps
	- The Web



### Getting bigger
Right now there are 6 billion mobile connections on the Earth. (Find out number of smartphones). 2.4 million billion people have access to the Internet. But the market is getting much much bigger. There's 6.8 billion people on the Earth and 

Moore's law is still very much in effect, so our tools for creation are getting more powerful all the time. Faster processors, and more capabilities.

More iPhones sold than babies born every day. 
850,000 Android devices activated today. 

> In 1986, a year after digital CDs widely debuted, vinyl records still accounted for 14 percent of all data on Earth, with audiocassettes holding an additional 12 percent.

### More Ubiquitous

### Getting Faster 
Everything is compounding on each other, much higher than exponential growth.

### Getting easier
It seems like we can create something every time we scratch our asses. How many have sent a text message from your pocket? That's how easy it is to create something these days.

## The Firehose
---------------------------------------------------------------
Does anyone else feel like this? I sure as hell do. These are my browser tabs on any given day. 

[tabs]

I thought I was bad until another web designer shared his tabs with me:

[necolas's tabs] 

This stat might be the most important one of the bunch. There are still only 24 hours in a day. There's only so many 5 Hour Energy drinks you can consume in a day, and even that won't help you. 

[4.8 5 hour energy drinks = 24 hours]

We as human beings have to do something about this firehouse of information. Our minds haven't evolved fast enough to retain all the information we're exposed to every day (which by the way is something like 34 gigabytes a day).  

And it's not like we can say "Time out, everybody! Let me sort through all of 2012 now. I'll be ready to go again in 2014"

# Bullshit
With the rise of all this information, there's been an increased rise in the amount of bullshit that's put into this earth.

I'm defining *bullshit* in several ways:
1. Superfluous, unnecessary 
2. Cluttered, clunky or needlessly complex
3. Intentionally deceptive 
4. Excrement of an adult male bovine mammal



# Bullshit
Advertising
Display Advertising
Banner ads

Commercials before movies in the theaters

Feature creep (Macy's stuff it to the gills)



## Advertising
I'm not going to get into the necessary evil that is advertising, but I will say 100% of people would opt out of being exposed to advertising if given the chance.

Our mobile phones deliver us exactly the content and functionality we want at precisely the time we request . Advertising of any sort looks glaringly out of place, and can even be seen as an invasion of privacy.

## The Art of Sincerity
http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/weve-been-arguing-about-irony-vs-sincerity-for-millennia/265601/

I firmly believe that moving forward it's going to be increasingly difficult to be an asshole and get away with it. 
It's getting really hard to sweep things under the rug. In some ways that's scary, but in many cases it has a net positive effect.  
From fact checking on presidential debates, To things like the Arab Spring. The only place where those environments can happen in modern times is where the flow of information is tightly restricted (North Korea, Iran?, etc).

On this side of proper, we have to care about what we do and what we put into this world. 

## Focus
Now more than ever we're required to focus. 
Future Friendly thinking laser focus
There's a difference between simplicity and focus. The Onion Apple click-wheel computer.

# The Future

Every data set is a puzzle piece in the largest puzzle ever put together. We're only just now starting to put the puzzle together. The Big Bang scattered particles across the universe, which eventually gathered to form stars, planets and other celestial entities. We're doing some 

If I had the opportunity to live at any point in history, from past to present day, I would live today, right here right now. If I could live in tomorrow's world, I would.

Every time you make a phone number findable and clickable. Every  time you make previously inaccessible information available, you're contributing to the advancement of civilization. 

This is how much information was created in the duration of this talk.

We are creators. We control what we put into the world. And we have a decision to make. Do you want to contribute to the signal, or to the noise? 

Thanks guys.

The way the teams were structured. Having 7 independent teams working on various aspects of the site meant that there was a lot of room for redundancy. 7 teams = 7 carousels = 7 button types, etc. 

I'd also change the process and get the design into the browser much sooner, and focus less on "mobile" and "desktop" browsers mock ups in Photoshops. Establishing a design system and a better workflow would have helped the project move along much smoother.

That process and planning impacts the final product just as much if not more than the technical aspects of the project.
